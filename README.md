Real World Change
Hi all, setting up a repo and discussion board here to help organize for problem solving to tackle pressing issues in the real world - especially given societal changes, economic changes, environmental changes (e.g. homelessness, mental health decline, crime, violence).

I think we all are horrified by the recent mass shootings in Texas on May 24. The worst part is that our children (our own future) paid the price of stupid decisions by the adults in power today. I can't stand around and let that continue to happen - so I want to find ways to make a difference; I want a better tomorrow. I hope you do too -- but we all know this isn't easy at all. Sadly, the violence is just a sign of the times - given again economic factors, societal factors, environment factors.

HOW CAN WE HELP CHANGE THE FUTURE?
Let's brainstorm here - even if it's just a handful of people in this community who want to volunteer, that's okay to me - I would just like to see more creative thought towards whatever we can do to make our future and our children's future better (not darker).

Encourage each other to collaborate, research. I think that's the easiest first step -- what resources are available today to combat the issues at present? What could be better about those resources? As coders, designers, product people, business leaders -- what can we come up with to improve resources or even make higher impact?

Should we organize fundraisers, donate to charities, encourage hackathons for change? I'm open to ideas here.

Finally, let's try to invite our friends and neighbors, our fellow students and classmates, our coworkers to this board and community. Let's encourage creative outlet - so that anyone who needs a place to get back on their feet can do so in a positive way.
